# FREE Load Testing Guide for Locus

## 🆓 Zero-Cost Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Local Development Testing (FREE)

#### Step 1: Start Local Development Server
```bash
cd locus
npm install
npm run dev
```

#### Step 2: Run Small Load Tests (FREE)
```bash
# Test with 10 users first
npm run load-test:small

# Test with 50 users
npm run load-test:medium

# Test with 100 users
npm run load-test:large
```

#### Step 3: Monitor Performance
- Check browser developer tools
- Monitor Firebase console
- Watch for errors in terminal

### Phase 2: Firebase Free Tier Testing (FREE)

#### Firebase Spark Plan Limits:
- ✅ **50,000 reads/day** - Sufficient for testing
- ✅ **20,000 writes/day** - Sufficient for testing
- ✅ **1GB storage** - More than enough
- ✅ **10,000 concurrent connections** - Perfect for 1000 users

#### Test Scenarios (All FREE):
1. **100 users × 100 questions = 10,000 operations**
2. **500 users × 100 questions = 50,000 operations**
3. **1000 users × 100 questions = 100,000 operations**

### Phase 3: Staged Testing Approach

#### Week 1: Small Scale (FREE)
- Test with 10-50 users
- Validate functionality
- Fix any issues

#### Week 2: Medium Scale (FREE)
- Test with 100-500 users
- Monitor performance
- Optimize bottlenecks

#### Week 3: Large Scale (Minimal Cost)
- Test with 1000 users
- Estimated cost: $0.25-0.50
- Full performance validation

## 🛠️ Free Testing Tools

- Error tracking

## 📊 Free Monitoring Setup

### 1. Firebase Console Monitoring
```javascript
// Add to your app for free monitoring
import { getAnalytics, logEvent } from "firebase/analytics";

// Track quiz performance
logEvent(analytics, 'quiz_started', {
  quiz_id: quizId,
  user_count: participantCount
});

logEvent(analytics, 'question_answered', {
  response_time: responseTime,
  question_id: questionId
});
```

### 2. Custom Performance Monitoring
```javascript
// Add performance tracking (FREE)
const performanceMonitor = {
  trackQuestionLoad: (questionId, loadTime) => {
    console.log(`Question ${questionId} loaded in ${loadTime}ms`);
    // Send to your analytics
  },
  
  trackAnswerSubmission: (questionId, responseTime) => {
    console.log(`Answer for ${questionId} submitted in ${responseTime}ms`);
    // Send to your analytics
  }
};
```

## 💡 Money-Saving Tips

### 1. Use Firebase Free Tier Wisely
- Test during off-peak hours
- Clean up test data after each test
- Use efficient queries

### 2. Optimize Before Testing
- Implement caching
- Use batch operations
- Optimize database queries

### 3. Test Incrementally
- Start small and scale up
- Fix issues before scaling
- Monitor costs in real-time

### 4. Use Local Testing First
- Test all functionality locally
- Only use cloud resources when needed
- Validate assumptions before spending
